# Lecture 0 Notes

## Setting Up the enviroment
Install [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/) to setup the virtual enviroment for the project.
```
conda create -n 6.86x python=3.8
```

Activate running
```
conda activate 6.86x
```

Finally, install all the required packages:
```
conda install pytorch -c pytorch
conda install numpy
conda install matplotlib
conda install scipy
conda install tqdm
conda install scikit-learn
```

## [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
In this lecture, we were introduced to NumPy, a powerful Python package for working with arrays and multidimensional matrices.

Examples of how to use this library can be found in [main.py](https://github.com/pulszao/mit_machine_learning/blob/main/lecture_0/main.py).
